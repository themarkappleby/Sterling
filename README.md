#Sterling

Sterling is yet another dropdown menu. It supports infinite levels of nesting automagically. Its fully functional with CSS alone, but JS is used to support variable width dropdowns. No jQuery needed. Unlike many existing dropdown menus, Sterling has a clear separation of functionality and styling so you can go crazy making it look sweet without having to worry about breaking it. Sterling has been tested in IE/6/7/8/9, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
